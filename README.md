# WhacAMole
This is a fun and exciting game where the objectives is to wack as many moles as possible as many times as possible to score the most points. The first level is a 3x3 grid where moles appear in random boxes for a random amount of time. This will keep you on your toes and keep the game interesting because there is no consistent pattern. In future updates of the game there will be multiple levels and different types of moles worth different amounts of points.
