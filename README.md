# WhacAMole
This is a fun and exciting game where the objectives is to wack as many moles as possible as many times as possible to score the most points. The first level is a 3x3 grid where moles appear in random boxes for a random amount of time. This will keep you on your toes and keep the game interesting because there is no consistent pattern. In future updates of the game there will be multiple levels and different types of moles worth different amounts of points.

# Coding Structures
This game ties together a variety of different kinds of HTML CSS and Javascript tools in order to bring the game to life. In this section I will break down how I coded each aspect of the game. 

<details> 
<summary> Start Page </summary>
<li>The start page was the first part I completed and was essentially an html page linked to the game page via the start game button. In addition to that I also added instructions to the game. The first page is when you are exposed to the special game font I found called 'Press Start 2p'. Addtional features added include the bounce animation feature to make the game more lively.

<summary>Game Page</summary>
<li> The gameboard was inspired by my prior experience in making a tic-tac-toe game. The 3x3 grid seemed like the perfect setup to run multiple functions while still being able to manipluate each box of the grid. I used the CSS flex property along with flex wrap to make the grid 3x3 boxes. 
<li> In addition to the gameboard the other features on the gamepage include the countdown timer, score display and play again button.

<summary>CSS Styling</summary>
<li>  As stated earlier I utilized CSS flexbox to orient where i wanted each element of my game to be located. I used multiple flex containers throughout the project to not only center my gameboard but my buttons as well.
<li> I was able to use the background size cover characteristic as well as background no repeat to get the most recent version of my background and this helped the aesthethic of my game tremendously.
<li> The most significant addition to my CSS toolbox was the animation which really helped me elevate the overall feel of my game. I made it 1s infinite so that it would continue to bounce and also so it was fast enough to notice. the 1s also made it so each second that went off the clock the timer would also bounce.
